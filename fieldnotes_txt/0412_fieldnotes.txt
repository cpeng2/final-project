April 12 Field Notes - Chinese Meetup
When I sit down at the cafe today the music is unusually loud. When I walked in several of the chairs were already overturned, as if the cafe staff was cleaning up early. Before I sat down I went to the counter to buy some food (a banana and a hot wrap) and a coffee. The coffee machine seemed not to be working properly and the two cafe workers, a tall thin harried looking African American guy in his 30s and a medium-height chubby latina woman in her 20s-30s were running around and calling to each other trying to communicate that certain drinks couldn’t be made since the machines were broken. After a short wait I got my Americano and food and headed over to the table.


When I sit down, there are already a few people at the same long table we used before:
  

* Mizu(MZ) is a tallish chinese woman who looks around 28-32 years of age. She has long straight hair put up in a pony-tail and light eye-liner. She is wearing a tan leather jacket with fluffy fur-lined sleeves. She is sitting in the middle of the table (on the South side of the table). 
* Across from MZ sits Ella, the European (Polish) girl that I encountered on Sunday. Ella has medium-length straight chestnut colored hair and a grey long-sleeved T-shirt. Ella is relatively quiet, not speaking much and speaking only quietly when she does speak. She does listen intently to the conversations going on around her.
* On Ella’s left sits Bob, a chinese man in his mid-thirties, with darker skin than usual and a more lined, weathered face. Bob has short black hair and glasses, and appears to be at the meetup to practice his English. Bob wears a goatee and wire frame glasses and was from a farming family in Henan.
* On MZ’s right is an old white man that I hadn’t met before, whom I call Gary. Gary is wearing a blue-and white checkered long-sleeve shirt. Gary is mostly bald but has some grey hair around the back of his head. He wears reading glasses and got a meal from the restaurant to eat while the rest of us got only drinks. (I got a banana, but didn’t eat it there)
* At the East end of the table near Bob, sat 3 people on stools somewhat removed from the rest of the group - only one of whom I recognized - old Fernando. One of the other ones was an Asian guy in his 20s whom I call Jay. Jay was wearing a purple hoodie with college lettering on it. I assumed he was trying to practice English.
* Next to Jay was a tall roundish white guy whom I call Andrew. Andrew wore a long-sleeved dark flannel shirt, a short stubbly beard, a grey wool driving cap, and glasses. He sat with a slight hunch.


When I sit down I join a conversation with MZ, Bob, Gary, and Ella. Talking about each of our backgrounds, MZ tells us she is from a minority ethnic group in China, the Äynu who are related to Persians. Gary the old guy proudly guesses which province she grew up in- having traveled a lot through China in the past. Bob tells us that he originally came from a family of famers in Henan. “Hunan?” asks Gary. “No, Henan” replies Bob. Gary seems to have a slight Southern drawl. There is very loud pop/dance music playing over the cafe speakers which makes it a bit hard to hear even the people sitting close to me. Gary asks Bob if his town has changed a lot recently and Bob says it’s a big city now, growing fast.


[English in Italics, Chinese in Bold]


Gary: People are leaving the farms, aren’t they? To go to the cities.
Bob: uh… not really. The labor… the government want to get everyone move to the cities, you know?
Gary: uh-hmm. 
Bob: the…. Inland, especially, with these people. Inland they don’t have much industry. 
Me: no jobs.
Bob: They don’t have no benefits. The place not good. Not good… at changing. No people are investing there. Changing fast, but uh, the jobs uh… in China, in china there is not good. But in the United States there is [couldn’t hear].
Gary: Also Shenzhen is a special economic zone - have you said that?
Bob: yeah.
MZ: special zone
Bob: special zone
MZ: special economic zone
Me: Chongqing?
Several people answered at once: Bob: No. Gary: Yeah, and also Shenzhen.
Me: Oh, Shenzhen yeah.
Bob: Chongqing is the first, uh, inland …. Investment area.
Gary: Yeah. Right., [he chuckles.] But i think a lot of companies are opening shop in smaller hamlet towns.
Bob: Oh, Apple, they opened a factory… in Chengzhou? Near- near there.
Gary: oh…. Where? where?
Bob: Chengzhou
Gary: Chengzhou! oh.
Bob: Big- big, city.
Gary: Oh! Yeah…! That’s the biggest city in Henan, right?
Bob: Also the biggest factory of uh… of Apple.
Gary: Oh… okay! Looks good! Nice! Also they’ve got a few good weeks over in Chengdong. They’ve come down to Yanchu and Chanmu. Chengzhou there’s those ghost cities? Very big … uh, uh
Bob: what is a ghost city?
________________
Gary: like people buy apartments in these big complexes here that are brand new.
Bob: That’s in the big city where people are buying apartments ah
Gary: uh big one.
Bob: and uh, very many.
Bob explains a little more about people buying empty apartments and shows us photos of it on his phone.
Gary, laughs and then says: But I’ve heard that in Chengzhou it’s because they should invest like it’s an investment. Because they don’t live there. It’s like a investment. 
Bob: People want to invest in the real estate, but uh, people don’t want to move there. They put money in the big building, but they want a big business. Nobody runs a business.
________________
Gary: they want to go where the action is. So why did they build it then?
Bob: The government has - has a plan.
Ella, laughing: the government has a plan?
Gary laughs too.
Bob: this is made by uh, by government. Not by - not by market. 
Gary: but it’s still done by entrepreneurs…? Who build these - these huge complexes with shopping malls..  right?
Bob: but they get money…
Gary: from the government. 
Bob: from the government. I don’t know maybe they think the economy… 
Gary: it stimulates the economy!


I notice a pattern here where Gary tries to finish Bob’s thoughts as he is thinking of the right way to say something. As Bob tells us about his life in English,  MZ and Ella listen quietly, occasionally interjecting “yeah” and nodding. 


Bob: they lease the land
Gary: haha. Sichuan too I think.
Bob says something in reply I couldn’t hear
Gary: Haha. Henan is close? Or far?
Bob: Xi’an especially.
Gary: You- you worked in Xian?
Bob: I worked in Xi’an.
Gary: Xi’an. Xi’an is also close to Sichuan - Henan, right?
Bob: No, it’s very far away.
Gary laughs
MZ: very far. Yeah.
Bob: I just uh, I was just there one month before the earthquake.
Gary: uh-huh, yeah… yeah…
Bob: I was there about one month before it happened. I had a plan that got delayed and I was stuck there but the plan finally went ahead, so I left before the earthquake.
Gary: Oh.
Me to MZ: Where you in the earthquake too?
MZ: No I was in Japan.
Everyone laughs.
Gary: Japan has earthquakes pretty often too [he continues chortling]. I was there one time for two weeks, one time I was there the hotel started shaking- I was scared to death! [he laughs again, remembering back]
Bob: All the time
MZ: yeah, every day they have those. Every day.
Gary: Oh…. heh heh heh heh
Me: What earthquake was it? Was it recently?
Gary: She was talking about Sichuan, but he was talking about the big earthquake earlier, in Sichuan. About ten years ago was it?
Me: oh, oh.
Gary: That destroyed a lot of buildings.
Bob: In my town there were about four of five people dead. They had their own home inside the mountains. We worked there, but the hill crushed. The first floor crushed. They left the first floor - but our floor stay the same. The first floor- was completely crushed. Another office building near us got crushed. but it was empty.


Gary punctuates his sentences with “oh”, “ah” as Bob is talking.


Gary: I also heard there was an earthquake in Qinghai. That’s a - that’s a- a little ways away from Sichuan right?
MZ: I don’t know, I am not from Qinghai.
Gary: Oh, uh, you traveled before to Sichuan?
MZ: no.
Gary: No! Really?! Okay. do you have any siblings/cousins that have been there?
MZ: haha, we chinese are all cousins, huh?
Gary: Oh, Okay. There are many [nick-names? I am not sure what he is saying here] (Yao duole xiao xu mingzi) most aini [aka Äynu] have grown up-
Trying to interrupt Gary MZ cuts in
MZ: yes, yes, yes. I have- I have- I  have twenty [I can’t make it out, siblings maybe], you know?
Everyone laughs
MZ: twenty, you see.
Gary: oh, hahaha, wow. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, heh heh heh!
MZ: because, they don’t have one child policy. They don’t have it, don’t have it.
Gary: why, why, why? I didn’t know. Right now they don’t have it. It doesn’t exist now, you know.
MZ: but, because minority groups-
Gary, cutting her off: need kids. They need children now...
Bob: My parents still has other siblings. My mother has, uh, about actually six siblings. My father has seven.
There are murmurs of “oh” and “yeah” in response.
Gary, chuckling: really?! 
Bob: yeah.
Gary: You’re from a farm family right?
Bob. yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gary: It’s like that where I’m from. The South, the mountains where I’m from. Some of my relatives have big families. But then things changed pretty quickly, you know.
Bob: yeah.
Gary: I heard poland also had a lot of big families.
Ella: huh?
Gary: poland also has a lot of big families.
Ella: uh-huh. But it’s most of the time on the country-side. Like in the cities - 
Gary: When people move to cities, they don’t want to so many
Ella: yeah!... 
Gary: It’s hard to… support them. 
Ella: two kids are… average i think- two kids. Both of the people…
Gary: oh, okay.
Ella: I have friends, she is- she has ten sisters, so, you know…. 
Gary and Ella chuckles at this together, “heh heh heh”
Ella: and one brother!... hehe, so we were joking that - the brother is the youngest - that the father was aiming for a son! hahahaha
Me: mmmmm
Gary: ah, that’s funny, yeah, yeah, hahaha. Like the movie “seven brides for seven brothers” - with the two families, hahahaha, seven,.... heheh
Gary turns to MZ: so you live in New York? 
MZ: I live in… Forest Hills. Queens. 
Bob: I live there before. haha
MZ: oh really?
Bob: I live there, I live there, for maybe… three years.
MZ: wow.
Gary: it’s a nice place.
MZ: it’s a nice area, yeah.
Gary says hesitatingly: uh is it very anping? Uh, let’s see, peaceful... peaceful (ping’an 平安)?
MZ, in a firm voice: quiet. (anjing 安静). 
Gary: anqing, oh okay
MZ: anjing! [emphasizing the sharp ‘j’ sound and the fourth-tone]
Gary: anjing! Okay. Forest (森林) - forest - 
Bob: Forrest Hills! 
Gary then struggles to remember the word for Hills for a few seconds, looking it up on the translation app Pleco - “po? Po? (坡) how do you say Forest Hills?”
Then MZ jumps in, understanding MZ: ah! Forest Hills (Sēnlín Xiǎo qiū)
Gary: Xiǎo qiū
MZ, confirming: uh-huh, Sēnlín Xiǎo qiū. 
Everyone chuckles.
MZ, smiling: Forest Hills.
Bob: Chinese translation!
Me, still not understanding: what does it mean? Sēnlín Xiǎo qiū?
MZ: Forest Hills!
Me: ahh.
Everyone chuckles.
Gary, to MZ: What neighborhood do you often go in New York?
MZ: I work in Midtown. In Midtown East twenty eighth street, center avenue.
Gary: oh, oh, ah, okay. oh, wow.
MZ: heheh, yeah.
Bob, speaking quickly in accented mandarin to MZ. MZ responds “hmm?” and Bob repeats himself, explaining that he works on “sixth avenue”. Bob asks MZ where she works “what job?” and she replies with a surprised quaver in her voice: “at a dental office”. 
Bob: “on sixth avenue”. 
Gary and Bob chuckle.
MZ shoots back at him: where do you live now?
Bob: I live in midtown (Zhong-cheng)
MZ: Zhong-cheng?
Bob: midtown.
MZ: oh.
Bob then in fast chinese with a somewhat low pitch asks MZ what is the boundary between midtown and downtown. 
MZ replies “bryant park”. 
Bob: bryan park? Is that a street?
MZ: no. it’s a park. [she pulls out a map on her phone to show him, pointing at it]. West - Midtown West. East - Midtown East.


…..
A few minute later a few more people arrived and the conversations split more into several pairs. Ben sat across from me. Ben had been at the past two meetups I’d been to. Today he was wearing his inexpensive banker suit, with a tan linen jacket, and his white collared shirt opened, exposing a teal-colored T-shirt underneath. Sitting to my right is Abram a middle aged Russian man with a New York accent and somewhat shy manner.




  



I turn to the people on my right and introduce myself, addressing myself to the older gent - Abram.
Me: hello, my name is (Ni-Ke) Nicholas.
Abram: Hello. My name is Ke.
Me: ke.
… there is a few seconds of silence where neither of us say anything.
Me: is this your first time coming here?
Abram: No, hahaha
Ben: uh… how many times? How many times?
Abram: uh… I forget. 
Ben: oh! Ha! Okay!
… a few seconds pass in silence.
Abram: that’s alright. I was studying then I stopped studying and forgot everything-
Ben: well, that’s more than most-
Abram: -including how many times ive been here.
Ben: you can say you forgot. You passed the first test.
Abram: what?
Ben: You can say I forgot (wo wang le)
Me: forgot (wang ji le)
Ben: yeah.
________________
Abram stays silent again at this.
Me: why did you… take a big break?
Abram: lazy?
Me and Ben both repeating him: lazy.
Aram: I don’t know how to say “lazy”
Ben: lazy (lan). Very lazy (hen lan)
Abram: very lazy.
His accent is pretty good for someone who claims not to know much, hitting the tones correctly, better than someone who would just be starting out.
Ben laughs, hahaha.
Abram, after not saying anything for a few seconds says, seeming somewhat embarrassed: I thought I’d just come hang out, and it’d put me in the mood. Something like that, you know?
Me: mm… I also used to come a lot two years ago. I mean it’s been about two years. So… this is my third time.
________________
Abram: oh! Well, I’m sure you’ve been studying all along!
Me: like two years ago?
Ben says slowly, sounding it out in his head before speaking: two... years... ago... and this year the same? Like this meetup?
Me: this… not much different. Almost the same.
Ben: Almost the same. okay…. 
Me:  we- we shall see.
Ben, laughing: all right,
Me: I think some people- some people are the same. Like, I recognize a few people. For example, I think at Sunday’s meetup I recognize like two - three people.
Ben: yeah. Yeah. yeah. 
Ben Sighs
Abram: so you guys lived in china? Or something like that? 
Ben, pointing at me: he did, I didn’t
Abram: so you want to?
Ben: want to live there?
Abram: yeah?
Ben, hesitates, then says: I don’t want to live in china. It’s more like a hobby.
Abram: oh, okay. 
Ben: it’s more utility. But it became a hobby. [he chuckles]
Me: I think- my girlfriend is cantonese. Her parents always are telling her that she needs to come to china. I - like - uh… I am a grad student. I know there are famous universities in Hong Kong so I think-
Abram: so wait! Whose mother? Whose parents told you to go to- 
Me: my girlfriend’s parents. Not mine. Mine don’t want me to go.
Ben laughs and then says: but can you speak cantonese?
Me: no I cannot speak it.
Ben:  a little bit?
Me: uh….. Yeah a little bit.
Abram switches into cantonese, saying a setance I cannot understand. 
Ben laughs and says : that’s a lot.
Shyly Abram replies: I think that’s pretty much all I know
Ben: wow… cantonese is very interesting.
Me: interesting? Why is it interesting?
Ben: uh…. Uhhh… it sounds- it sounds very interesting.
Abram: I actually like the sound of Cantonese better than uh, mandarin.
Me, interjecting quickly: I think there’s fewer, uh… collisions right? [ I look to Ben, hoping the understands the computer science analogy and he nods, saying “yeah”] in mandarin there are so many and I think in cantonese there’s a lot less. So…
Abram: more vareity. More phonetic variety I guess. 
Me: yeah….
An awkward moment of silence creeps in here


Abram: Can you read? Can you guys read and write?
Ben: I can, I can, I can. I- Like most. I always find that one letter. That one character- I can’t do it. But yeah…. 
Me to Abram: why did you come today I mean like why did you decide to return today?
Abram: because the temperature is above 50 degrees?
Me and Ben together: Aaaah!
Ben: weather’s very good.
Abram: so coming out of hibernation, you know? Very simple.


Ten seconds of silence pass


Abram: just walk from 84th street. [he sounds like he has a staten-island or brooklyn accent the way he says “84th” like “eighty-foawth” drawing it out and not pronouncing the “R”]
Me: 84th?
Abram: yeah, yeah. 84th and 1st.
Me: okay. 
Ben: really?! Why?
Abram: well, I live there. So I might as well-
Ben: oh! Weather is good.
Abram: when it’s a nice walk-
Ben: that’s a great walk! That’s a great walk!
Abram: -I need to regain my- yeah, hahaha.


A few seconds pass in silence.


Me: what street number are we on? What street number are we on?
Ben: 28 (ershi ba) [he could also be saying 20, right? Since it’s pronounced the same (ershi ba), but this jogs my memory that the metro stop is 28th street.]
Ben: we are on 28th street. You were on 80th.
Me: is it 28th street (ershi ba de jie)?
Ben: yeah! Yeah- uh…. Yeah! That’s fine. [In reality I should not have used “de” and just said “28 Jiē”]


At this point another guy arrives and sits down next to us - Shawn, the young bald white guy from last week. 
Ben: is it your first time here?
Shawn: this is my third time here, you know?
Ben: what was your last time here...?
Me: I saw him here last time! You… sat over there! [I say, indicating the smaller table where Shawn sat last time in a pair with a chinese girl].
Ben: oh yeah! Last week there were many people.
Abram: really?
Ben: last week, yeah.


As Ben and Shawn introduce themselves a cafe worker walks up to our end of the table and offers us complimentary drinks, which surprises Abram. I tell Abram in chinese that I think their coffee machine is broken and ask if he understands. He responds: oh! I see, they were scraping the bottom - there was just one - one kind when I ordered.


At this point Ben is telling Shawn his chinese name, and explaining which characters make it up, and illustrating the significance behind the characters, by telling what other words the characters are parts of. This is pretty common for chinese speakers to do when they first meet - it is easiest to tell someone how to write the characters in your name by telling them what other common word the character is in, which also helps add meaning to the word.


Ben explains to Shawn that he got his name from his chinese friend who gave him several candidate names to choose from. Ben has explained this at least 1 or 2 times before to my knowledge but he doesn’t seem to tire from telling the tale, repeating it all, and adding or subtracting details with a smile on his face.


I ask Abram where he is from and he tells me he is from Russia. Alternatively pronounced “e guo” or “e’wosi”  - an older term that was more prevalent during the time when the USSR still existed. I ask Abram if he knows much about the chinese people who are moving into the part of Russia near Mongolia, and Abram says in a somewhat annoyed voice that he doesn’t know anyone in Russia any more and moved here to the US many years ago, and doesn’t maintain any contact with people there so he doesn’t really know what’s going on.


I overhear Ben talking about Chengyu - four-syllable chinese idioms. Ben is telling Shawn “if you know chengyu, chinese speakers will be very impressed.” I repeat back to Ben the english translation of a chengyu he told me at the Sunday meetup - “A famous teacher trains a fine student” huh? Abram joins in saying - I know one - “dog shit luck” (走狗屎运) - meaning you come across good luck (by stepping in dog shit) during a time of misfortune.


At 7:08pm my contact Joe arrives and sits down between Shawn and Abram. He asks everyone their name, and for the next few minutes the entire group chats in English - having apparently forgotten their goal of practicing Chinese. Perhaps just enjoying each other’s company more.


It is at this point that I take the photos shown above, and explain a little bit about my research as a participant observer.


  
  

After I take the first photo of Shawn, Joe, and Abram, Abram starts telling us about how chinese people tell each other to say eggplant (qiezi) when they are taking a photo - since it sounds similar to “Cheese” in english and makes your lips make the same smiling motion. Joe - the only native chinese speaker here seems surprised at this. “You don’t say one, two, three, seven?” he asks? Seven (qi) also sounds a bit like “cheese”, and I guess it makes more sense when counting.


Trends that I am noticing
* People talk about where they are from and where each other are from
* Most of the conversation is in english with Chinese sprinkled in
* Gary (old white american guy) seems to dominate and direct the conversation that he is in early on.
* People tend to repeat the last few words the other person said to show they comprehend, and are usually right, but sometimes are corrected.
* It seems most people come here more to socialize than to really try to learn chinese in a serious way - although Ben seems to really come here to practice, and MZ says she comes to be able to help people learn chinese.
* It seems like some of the Chinese guests really enjoy teaching vocab and helping out people learn Chinese, more than just talking about life in China (e.g. MZ, Joe)

	I notice a pattern here where Gary tries to finish Bob’s thoughts as he is thinking of the right way to say something. As Bob tells us about his life in English,  MZ and Ella listen quietly, occasionally interjecting “yeah” and nodding. 


	Bob: they lease the land
Gary: haha. Sichuan too I think.
Bob says something in reply I couldn’t hear

A few minute later a few more people arrived and the conversations split more into several pairs. Ben sat across from me. Ben had been at the past two meetups I’d been to. Today he was wearing his inexpensive banker suit, with a tan linen jacket, and his white collared shirt opened, exposing a teal-colored T-shirt underneath. Sitting to my right is Abram a middle aged Russian man with a New York accent and somewhat shy manner.




  



I turn to the people on my right and introduce myself, addressing myself to the older gent - Abram.

As Ben and Shawn introduce themselves a cafe worker walks up to our end of the table and offers us complimentary drinks, which surprises Abram. I tell Abram in chinese that I think their coffee machine is broken and ask if he understands. He responds: oh! I see, they were scraping the bottom - there was just one - one kind when I ordered.


At this point Ben is telling Shawn his chinese name, and explaining which characters make it up, and illustrating the significance behind the characters, by telling what other words the characters are parts of. This is pretty common for chinese speakers to do when they first meet - it is easiest to tell someone how to write the characters in your name by telling them what other common word the character is in, which also helps add meaning to the word.


Ben explains to Shawn that he got his name from his chinese friend who gave him several candidate names to choose from. Ben has explained this at least 1 or 2 times before to my knowledge but he doesn’t seem to tire from telling the tale, repeating it all, and adding or subtracting details with a smile on his face.


I ask Abram where he is from and he tells me he is from Russia. Alternatively pronounced “e guo” or “e’wosi”  - an older term that was more prevalent during the time when the USSR still existed. I ask Abram if he knows much about the chinese people who are moving into the part of Russia near Mongolia, and Abram says in a somewhat annoyed voice that he doesn’t know anyone in Russia any more and moved here to the US many years ago, and doesn’t maintain any contact with people there so he doesn’t really know what’s going on.


I overhear Ben talking about Chengyu - four-syllable chinese idioms. Ben is telling Shawn “if you know chengyu, chinese speakers will be very impressed.” I repeat back to Ben the english translation of a chengyu he told me at the Sunday meetup - “A famous teacher trains a fine student” huh? Abram joins in saying - I know one - “dog shit luck” (走狗屎运) - meaning you come across good luck (by stepping in dog shit) during a time of misfortune.


At 7:08pm my contact Joe arrives and sits down between Shawn and Abram. He asks everyone their name, and for the next few minutes the entire group chats in English - having apparently forgotten their goal of practicing Chinese. Perhaps just enjoying each other’s company more.


It is at this point that I take the photos shown above, and explain a little bit about my research as a participant observer.


  
  

After I take the first photo of Shawn, Joe, and Abram, Abram starts telling us about how chinese people tell each other to say eggplant (qiezi) when they are taking a photo - since it sounds similar to “Cheese” in english and makes your lips make the same smiling motion. Joe - the only native chinese speaker here seems surprised at this. “You don’t say one, two, three, seven?” he asks? Seven (qi) also sounds a bit like “cheese”, and I guess it makes more sense when counting.


Trends that I am noticing
* People talk about where they are from and where each other are from
* Most of the conversation is in english with Chinese sprinkled in
* Gary (old white american guy) seems to dominate and direct the conversation that he is in early on.
* People tend to repeat the last few words the other person said to show they comprehend, and are usually right, but sometimes are corrected.
* It seems most people come here more to socialize than to really try to learn chinese in a serious way - although Ben seems to really come here to practice, and MZ says she comes to be able to help people learn chinese.
* It seems like some of the Chinese guests really enjoy teaching vocab and helping out people learn Chinese, more than just talking about life in China (e.g. MZ, Joe)
