Chinese - English Exchange at Pret a Manger
Thursday, April 5, 2018
6:30am - 9pm


In the rush hour bustle I am crammed into the crowded 6 train. When I get to 28th street station I push my way through the press of bodies to exit the train, trying not to trip or fall on anyone as the crowd presses around me. A brunette white girl with a black backpack in front of me has fewer compunctions and roughly pushes her way through the subway’s open doors.


From the subway stop I cross the street and enter the Pret a Manger - a slightly upscale version of a coffee franchise chain, like a nicer starbucks. The cafe is relatively large, perhaps 150 ft by 60 ft with large wooden tables and large bright windows. The cafe is also relatively empty at this late hour, with perhaps 10-15% of the seats being used when I walk in.


When I arrive, I notice two people from the meetup seated at a large table in the center of the cafe. One of them is my contact - a Taiwanese guy in his early thirties, whom I will call Joe. The other is a Chinese girl I had met over a year ago, but had very little memory of I will call her Ashley.


  



The two of them had been chatting and smiling. When I arrive, they both greet me in Chinese - a language I am semi-fluent in - and we share some pleasantries mostly in Chinese, sprinkling in English here and there.


After a minute or two a fourth person arrives, we can call him Mark. Mark is tall, white, with blue eyes and light brown hair. He is dressed in a knitted black jacket / sweater.


Mark introduces himself in Chinese. This is his first time at the meetup group. We speak, switching back and forth between Chinese as we go. Mark asks if Joe is “jeesee” which confuses us, perhaps this is a chinese word we don’t know or that Mark is mispronouncing. After a few seconds we realize he was saying “GC” i.e. group coordinator. We realize that he is trying to ask if Joe is the organizer to which we say no, laughing.


Mark asks Joe what province (assumedly in China) Joe is from. Joe answers that he is actually from Taiwan. In return Joe asks Mark where he is from, and Mark invites us to guess. We try to guess what he is, laughing, all the while. This is Mark’s first time to the Chinese meetup group.


Eventually Joe guesses that he is Russian to which he says “yes” and everyone laughs and says “amazing” in english. I say in broken chinese “it’s not so strange” - people stare at me confused for a sec and then realize i used the wrong word for strange and correct me.


From here on out I will indicate english speech with italics and my translations of the chinese with bold.


At that moment another chinese man whom I will call Xiaohong in his 30s arrives and joins the conversation. He is of average height and build, with a slightly pockmarked tan face. Joe points him out as the real organizer and laughs as he introduces himself. The organizer jokingly says that Joe is a sort of informal organizer of the group. The girl who was there at the beginning says very funny!.


Afterward Joe turns back to Mark and asks him (in chinese) how long he has studied chinese.
Mark: a six years
Joe: six years!
Mark: in Shanghai.
Joe replies In Shanghai? You studied chinese in Shanghai? What kind of school in Shanghai?
Mark: China Eastern Normal University (hua dong shi da)
Joe: China Eastern Normal University! How great! How did you like it there?
Mark: I think the school was not good because I studied Chinese.
Joe: but I thought it was not bad
Mark: it wasn’t great
Joe: really?! 
Mark: right. It was not that great.
Joe and Ashley: Oh~ 
Joe: Bu I thought it-
Mark: it is a good school, but for studying chinese it is not good.
Joe and Ashley: Oh
Joe: So how long did you spend there in Shanghai? Two years?
Mark: 3 years
Joe: 3 years, oh.
Ashley: just studied chinese?
Mark: no, two years masters, one year undergrad.
Joe: so do you like shanghai?
Mark: Yeah I liked it
Ashley: So why did you come to new york?
After having some trouble what mark is saying in Chinese Joe switches to English: oh, you’re only visiting.


At this point it is 6:40pm. There are now 7 people there - 5 apparently chinese and 2 white (me and the Russian guy Mark)


Mark explains in chinese that he is currently taking classes at the local community college. Joe switches between chinese and english and starts explaining that he himself teaches Chinese classes at the local city college and is surprised that he hasn’t seen Mark there. And then says in english “so we are both on spring break”
Mark: I should take your class
Joe: I should give you my office number. I should give you my business card, I should give you my business card, here you go.
Ashley: okay very good.


Joe: Ok, so did you finish your bachelors at HuaShiDa or no?
Mark: Yes, HuaShiDa, no it was not HuaShiDa
Joe: Oh! XaiDing University!
Mark: XaiDing University, just one year.
Joe: Shanghai XaiDing university…. 


Joe seems to repeat everyone’s last statement after they say it, seemingly to confirm that he has heard and understood.


Mark: You all in china, where? (in this case I am sure Mark is speaking with broken chinese, trying to ask where the others are from)
Ashley: We are taiwanese
Joe: We are taiwanese 
* The other chinese people seated at the end of the table next to ashley laugh and pretend to move their chairs further away. One of the chinese girls who pulled her chair away, whom I will call MingMing says: “you guys are outsiders” causing Joe and Ashley to laugh heartily.


Joe seems to laugh very freely, although his friend Ashley seems a bit more reserved.


Joe: So when we make a good friend from another country we feel very confused. 
Ashley: Haha!
Joe: … because we don’t have any diplomatic ties with any other countries. So- 
Ashley: (cuts in in chinese about making friends with foreigners - hard for me to understand the audio)
Joe: So when we make a foreigner best friend ...


As I am being very quiet taking notes at this point there seem to be roughy 5 native speakers of chinese, talking mostly to each other and to Mark the Russian guy. They speak mostly in chinese, but occasionally interject an english word - often as way of exclamation, often followed by repeating what the other person just said. E.g. “I don’t have many foreigner friends unfortunately.” others: “unfortunately”


As the group begins to get bigger, side conversations start opening up. Mark turns to his left (instead of talking across the table with Joe and Ashley), speaking to a chinese guy in a checked blue shirt who gesticulates with his hands as he speaks in chinese. Joe, now mostly listening in on the conversation, follows along saying “right, dui (right)”  switching between english and chinese as he does so.


All this while there has been a quiet guy sitting to my left, who looks chinese, and has been listening in on the conversation. I will call him Ted. He is casually dressed, with somewhat darker skin than the other chinese attendees. Joe engages him in conversation, asking in english if he speaks Chinese. Ted replies in English “I try”. When asked if he often comes to these meetups in an uncertain slow pace Ted says “I come more” which doesn’t make a ton of sense in the context. Joe understands what he is trying to say and corrects him “You are coming more and more often”
Joe: Where are you from?
Ted: I was born in Beijing, I grew up in California
Joe: You grew up in California, oh… So then, why are you in New York?
Ted: oh eh… he hesitates, searching for the right words. Even though I cannot understand what exactly Ted is saying as he searches for words, it is apparent that he has a strong Beijing accent… I heard from friends that it is interesting here.
Joe: you heard it was interesting…, oh… as some seconds tick by you can tell Joe is looking for a topic to pivot to, to keep the conversation going. So do you have a job? While such direct questioning might seem rude or out of place in normal conversation, in this informal setting it seems a common question to ask, and the more direct the easier for people who are new to the language.
Ted: yes, i work in a lab.
Joe: in a lab...
Ted: yeah.
Joe: What kind of lab
Ted: ummmm, uuhhh, biology
Joe: A biology lab.
Ted: yeah.
Joe: Oohh. I am… I am.. Now Joe seems to be the one searching for words. In the end he switches to english, perhaps not having an easy way to explain. So I teach english and chinese in the city unicersity of new york. I am a chinese professor. And I am a PhD of linguistics.
Ted: Oh okay. In new york you did your - 
Joe: PhD, yes.
Ted: Oh. At… at… at… where?
Joe: Huh? At CUNY - City University of New York


Ted explains to Joe in halting Chinese that he also did a PhD. Joe asks him if he is doing a post-doc now, to which Ted replies no. Joe asks, so what kind of research are you doing? Ted replies in chinese that he is a researcher. Switching to English Joe asks, trying to clarify “what kind of researcher are you? Research assistant, post-doc, …” to which Ted replies “assistant, assistant.” Ted then asks Joe to clarify what word he should have been using. Joe asks, what kind of place is he working in chinese and Ted replies “it is a nonprofit”


[it seems that english speakers default to using english words for things that they do not know Chinese vocabulary for, and that Joe at least will also try to simplify his chinese to speak to chinese learners and switch to english himself if he feels they cannot understand.]


At 6:44 there are two conversations going on at the same big table - Jerry and Ted and Mark and about 4-5 chinese members at the other end of the table (towards the windows).


A Taiwanese girl with a bob haircut sits down at the other side of Joe from Ashley. I will call this girl Scotty. Ted starts talking to Scotty who is sitting across from him and who has been silent until now. Ted continues to speak a bit quietly and hesitatingly, causing Scotty to crane her head closer to him to hear, since at this point there are several conversations going on and the background music is still a bit high. When there are words Ted doesn’t understand either he or Scotty switches to using english.


A chinese student (I call Wenchao) begins engaging me in conversation, hoping to practice his english.


Wenchao asks me if I have been to these meetups before and I explain that I used to come when I first came to New York, a few years ago to practice mandarin. I tell him that I am now here for a class to analyze the meetup. I ask Wenchao if he comes very often to the meetups?
Wenchao: This one? 
Me: this one, or in general


Wenchao asks me about what i am studying at the meetup. I ask if he comes to these meet ups a lot. He says he does, but that it is pretty time consuming but is a good way to practice. He asks me what school I go to and what I major in. i tell him i am in the information systems major at nyu and that I am taking notes for my ethnography class. Upon hearing what my major is Wenchao quickly asks me if I use association rules - an old fashioned machine learning technique that is not commonly used these days. I am surprised he even knew about association rules. I stutter out an answer in chinese that I do know how to use them, but do not really use them often. I explain that although I do program a bit I am trying to pick up more qualitative methods in addition to data mining techniques like deep learning.


Wenchao then asks if I have to use TensorFlow - a popular software library used for deep learning with artificial neural networks. I explain that I do use it but that it’s not necessarily required for my major. Wenchao explains that he is majoring at business analytics at Fordham. I reply “oh! I am a PhD and I teach business analytics!” When I ask if he then uses TensorFlow he says “no” somewhat sheepishly. “We don’t have one class to learn it, but I can learn it online.”


I again ask if he comes to these meetups very often and if he ever writes down words in english he doesn’t know. Wenchao explains that he comes alot. He doesn’t write down words he doesn’t know because he already studied for the GRE and picked up lots of vocabulary there,  and is now trying to pick up speaking in a more casual setting - getting practice getting up there and being bold, most people don’t use very fancy word in common speech.


He asks me how I first started coming to the meetups here. I ended up making a friend with one of the group’s members when I first got here. I tell Wenchao that my friend and I ended up becoming running buddies and would switch of speaking english one day and chinese the next, but that was a long time ago - 2 years ago - and that friend has since moved away.


Wenchao switches to speaking a mix of chinese and english to me while I reply mostly in english to him.


In English Wenchao told me he also has a partner who he sees outside the group for english and chinese exchanges, and describes how they hang out during spring break.


I ask him “is it your friend or your partner?” He asks me the difference and I explain that a partner is more like a “boyfriend” if he doesn’t have more context - like in a project or a language partner or a business partner.


Wenchao asks me how I first started to study chinese - a relatively common question at these meetups - but interestingly he said how instead of why, which may be more common in chinese in general now that I think about it.


I explain my own introduction to the language - I went on a research program in china many years ago, came back and started taking mandarin classes in university, and now that I am in New York I can come to the meetups to practice mandarin.


Wenchao comments that meetups are one of the great things about new york city and I concur. I ask if he has ever been to the meetups on Sunday for chinese exchange. He says he never goes to those ones, but there are other language exchange meetups that take place at a bar in which people from many different languages come and split off into smaller groups. 


I move to sit on the other side of Ted who was previously on my right, and sit down on a round black leather stool between Ted and another white guy from the Bay Area named David. 


In English I ask Ted so you’re from San Francisco? 
Ted: yeah I grew up there.
Me: I’m from Contra Costa County
Ted: Oh wait, [laughing] I’m also from contra costa county. My parents moved to Berkeley and then later to Richmond when I was in like 7th grade …
Me: Oh yeah…
David: Yeah, I grew up also in the Bay Area, in Cupertino, you know it?
Ted: Yeah. Where in Contra Costa did you grow up?
Me: Walnut Creek? Pleasant Hill?
Ted: What High School did you go to?
Me: [my high school]
Ted: Oh… I used to know schools like Acalanes?
Me: Yeah, we used to play them in track and stuff.
Ted: Cool… 
At this point he trailed off as if thinking of what to say.
Ted: Oh! Is it close to [local community college]? 
Me: Yeah! It’s across the street from there.
Ted: Yeah, I took a class from there once, it was hell to get to.
Me: yeah…
Ted: It took like 40 minutes, trying to take the BART [rapid transit]
David: Public transportation in California is rough
________________
Ted and Me: yeah, yeah.
Ted: if you live next to the BART it’s pretty good.
David: Yeah but in Cupertino if I want to get to my friend’s house, you know … I gotta take a bus there … take a couple buses in a couple hours you can make it.
Ted asks me why I started to learn Chinese and I switch back into chinese and explain that I visited the country when I was 20, was really impressed, and decided to study the language when I came back to college. And you? I ask Ted.
Ted: I was born in Beijing, then (at) one year old, came to US. uhhh. Then… lived in [somewhere] 2-3 years, uh, but, uh… apart from my mom and dad I didn’t have many opportunities to speak Chinese, so I came here.
Me: Don’t you have chinese-speakers in your lab you can practice with?
Ted: Yes there are many in my department but my chinese…[he hesitates] is so-so… When them and I are together I get nervous, a little nervous you know what I mean? There’s always that moment where- I have kinda a pretty good accent so, you know- [when he switches into english his nervousness seems to go away and a note of comraderie enters his voice]
Me: they have high expectations.
Ted: Yeah exactly! [he sounds relieved that someone understands]. You know, it’s like past the simple stuff there’s always a moment where I don’t understand what anyone is saying but I’m kind of nodding, haha. There’s a point where you can’t peice together what they’re saying from the context any more.
Me: Exactly.


I start talking (in English) about how I also studied Portuguese in college, and when I first went to Brazil I just nodded along with everyone without really understanding, but after a while the phrases you don’t know start repeating in your mind as your sleep, and then you kinda figure it out.
Ted: Yeah, yeah exactly. It probably helps to be immersed a shit-ton. [it occurs to me that “shit-ton” is slang might be slang that’s more specific to California]
Yeah so I would like to spend more time in China town, …. [he kinda mumbles here] … although they really speak more Fujianese I think…
Me: Oh really! Specifically in this Chinatown?
Ted: Well, I think there are just a lot of Fujianese people in New York in general. So like in Flushing and stuff… yeah. Yeah so… it’s kinda an um...
[For context, Fujian is the province in China that is closest to Taiwan].
David: You’re saying in Chinatown there are a lot?
Ted: yeah. Fujian province. They have their own dialect.
David: Yeah I notice when I go to Chinatown I don’t really understand a lot of what they are saying.
Ted: Maybe Cantonese too…
David: Yeah! Cantonese. 
Ted: Yeah. A lot of those people can speak Mandarin. They just prefer to speak, you know.
David: To their own… like if you interact with people you can definitely factor it in…. Um… um… uh...


It is apparent at this point that we have run out of things to talk about, and need to switch to a new topic. Switching into Chinese Ted picks up the conversation.


Ted: So what’s your job?
Me: I’m a graduate student (i.e. research student, “yanjiusheng”)
Ted: research what?
He repeats the word questioningly. I think he is asking me what “yanjiu” (i.e. research) means.
Me: research student (yanjiu xuesheng) like research. I’m a grad student. so...
Ted: What major?
Me: My major is uh… business? [I forget the word for business student in Mandarin] Information systems, information systems [I repeat this in english since it is an uncommon word so I want to make sure he understands.] so like Business Analytics, that kind of thing.
Ted: ok so kinda like, uh.. Uh,. uhh… how did you say computer science again? 
David: yeah I studied computer science
Ted: no how do you say it?
David, Ted, and I all say together: computation...
David: … science
Ted: that sounds like a super-literal translation.
David: how would you say it?
Ted: I don’t know! Yeah, I really have no idea. Umm…. uh… 
David: maybe that’s it
Ted: I’m just a little surprised there’s not a more, uh, coloquial, um, anyway. [Ted turns to me] You also study computation … things...?
Me: Uh… this is my… third year
Ted: third year. 


As we sit here speaking english there is a Chinese guy in a grey sweater I will call Bingbing who occasionally cranes his head over and tries to overhear us speaking. As we continue the conversation we continue to switch back and forth between English and Chinese. With switches occurring especially when we don’t know what to say, and when we do speak in chinese we do so in a halting, hesitating manner.

Soon afterward a tall black guy whom I call Ben joins us at our end of the table, sitting on a stool between Ted and I. Ben was dressed in a tan business suit, short cut hair, and silver-rimmed glasses. We talk about his work at a bank. He forgets momentarily how to say “interesting” and we both think of different ways to say it after a second. He explains that he is also a software engineer working for a top bank here in the city. He reminds us how to say computer as opposed to computation. I point out that the characters for computer literally mean “electric brain” and everyone goes oh, we hadn’t realized …. Ben explains that he himself has a masters in computer and electrical engineering. Ted asks him if they are very different, and Ben replies that at the advanced levels they are pretty similar. He has both programmed and computers and built them from scratch! We realize that the word for computation literally translates as calculation machine.

At this point I try to exit the conversation again so I can take notes without being so closely involved. Ben and Ted start talking and ask each other how long they’ve been speaking or learning mandarin. Ted explains again that he was born in Beijing, then moved to California where he grew up. 

As Ted and Ben have a more one-on-one conversation sitting around the corner of the large table, Bingbing, who is sitting to Ben’s left tries to raise his voice a bit and talk to David across our little corner. It is clear that there is some confusion between them partially becaue of the language barrier but also becuase there are now so many conversations going on around the table that it is getting a bit hard to hear clearly.


Going around the table clockwise, starting from the center guy in the grey hoodie: Joe, Scotty, David, Me [out of frame], Teddy [out of frame], Ben [out of frame], BingBing (talking to David), Wenchao (you can see his nose), Mark, the organizer - Xiaohong in blue. The pair in the right of the frame are also part of the meetup group and sat together talking the whole time behind Xiaohong. 

Apart from me nobody moved from the seats they took at first. Although people would pivot between conversation partners, to the left and right. An interesting observation from this night is that at our end of the table we had four out of the seven non-native chinese speakers culstered together. While at the other end of the table, there was only one non-native speaker (Mark). The two pairs that split off from the main table were mixed chinese and non-chinese: the young bald white guy and chinese girl in the right of the photo, and the elderly white man whom I will call Shawn and Kaiyi, the skinny tall chinese guy sitting behind Xiaohong, the organizer.

Looking around the room at 7:18 I see 16 attendees and 6 different conversations- four at the big table, and two pairs off to the sides. From what I could tell there were four White Americans (two of us from the SF Bay Area), one Black American - Ben (born in Kenya, grew up in New Jersey), one Asian American - Teddy (grew up in SF, went to school in UCLA), one Russian - Mark, three Taiwanese - Joe, Ashley, and Scotty, and six people from Mainland China. Nearly everyone looked to be between 25-35 except the elderly Fernando. 

Most people are bent intently over the table, clearly engaged in their conversations. 


Ben has pretty good chinese - as good as any of us other non-native speakers - and says that he learned all on own, merely by speaking with friends, and going to meetups and, and practicing writing every day. 
I ask Ben, impressed, if he really practices writing every day?! Ben takes out his iphone, and show us an app called Skritter.
  

^An image of the app Skritter


Ben demonstrates that by tracing characters with his finger he can practice writing. If he writes the wrong stroke it won’t appear on the screen - forcing him to try again to learn. Ben angles his phone to show to Ted, demonstrating writing things with his index finger as he goes.


Ted asks Ben if he uses wechat. Ben shows us briefly the many alerts for messages he has received recently from friends that are all written in chinese. He received them in wechat - an app similar to wechat or facebook messenger that is very popular in china, and with chinese expats in the US. 


Ben also tells us about another favorite app of his - called Pleco - an offline english-to-chinese dictionary.
Ben: I actually think without it I wouldn’t be this far. It’s so good, it seems unfair.
Me: Yeah I agree, I use the flash-card function on it, although I guess that lost of other apps have that function to.
… we look around for a few moments thinking of something else to say.


Ted asks Ben in chinese if he has been to China to which Ben replies “no, I have never gone.”
Ted: I’ve gone a few times. If you could go to china where would you go?
Ben: probably taiwan, if china then i’d like to spend a week in Chengjung
Ted: I think you need a visa to go to Taiwan
Ben: yeah you need a visa or something, but for americans you don’t need anything. They don’t require anything, they want people to go.
Ted: I am a chinese citizen, so when I want to go to the UK next month I need to apply for a visa and pay $150. My friend went to london, and france
Ted then puts up his hands in exasperation and nervousness
Ben: where do you live?
Ted: Williamsburg
Ben: where were you born?
Ted: beijing. 1 year old.
Ben: where did you move when you were 1
Ted: California (jiazhou) 
Ben : jiazhou? Wait give me a second - california? I drove a car there and back! Just one time
Ted: how long did it take?
Ben: From NY to Chicago, then Denver, to see friends. In chicago and denver i have many friends,
Ted says mmm mmm mm each time in between the pauses in Ben’s story, to indicate that he has heard and understood.
Ben: how do you say gasoline? 
Ted: QiYou
Ben: we ran out of oil. We stopped in Vegas because we had to. It was directly on the way and we had no other way, so we stopped the car for a few hours (laughing)
Ted: how long?
Ben: 3 hours. My other friends didn’t have money. (switching to english) they gambled and lost a lot of money - FAST
Ted: I would say they lost a lot of money.
Ben: how do you say lost? “Milule” is saying you got lost. Giving the chinese and gambling there’s probably a word for that.


At this point Ben opens app on his phone to look up the word. Ben shows it to Ted and says “kuile (亏了)” which sounds like “quay-luh” in english.
Ted, reading the pinyin off the screen says “kwee-luh”.
Ben: “quay-luh”
Ted: oh, “quay-luh”


Ben: my friend had no money, but I had money. Laughs, I just watched him gamble. we went to LA and went to a suburb with a walmart, do you know that suburb? 
Ted: no...
Ben: All I know is that it was hilly and there were lots of chinese people. But In LA there are way more chinese people overall than in New Jersey so I bet anywhere I went would seem like tons of Asians...
Ted: Gabrial Park, San Marion … asian beverly hills.
Ben: but that was before the ultra-wealthy moved in. now millionaires move in, buy a house and leave it empty. That’s what i've heard
Ted: yeah, I bet that if their kids go to american schools...
Ben: chinese people love american schools
…
As Ben and Ted continue to talk I look around the room. Most people most ppl seem engaged deeply in conversation. There is one convo off to the side between a bald white guy and a chinese girl in her late 20s wearing a blue long-sleeve sweater with thin white horizontal stripes. At the end of the table there is Fernando, a regular with grey hair, balding, talking to another chinese guy apart from the rest of the people around the bigger table. Then Kaiyi nods as Fernando peers through his bushy eyebrows and gestures emphatically with his hands while he is talking.


There are many people smiling and laughing, only one or two people listening along silently and occasionally nodding.


Back to the conversation between Ben and Ted.


Ben: My parents were born in africa, but I was born in New Jersey
Ted: What part?
Ben: Eastern part of Africa - sometimes they say North East …. But they mean Eastern
Ted: How do you say Kenya? what do they speak in Kenya?
Ben: Swahili 
Ben: Kenya has two languages - swahili and english. speaking english is not hard for my parents. Coming here wasn’t a big deal to them. But sometimes they would mix things up. I could go back to kenya if i read a few books.
Ted: Is there any other language you want to learn?
Ben: Korean…. Swahili is not as used. If I speaks swahili, my parents would be very happy. It’s way easier!
Ted: Chinese is easier!?
Ben: Swahili is easier. It uses latin characters. Latin characters. The grammar is similar to english grammar. In Kenya, is in the hindu region. In english swahili is a mix of many languages - portuguese, hindu, bantu, etc. “Casa” is table in both portuguese and swahili
Me: you mean “mesa”? “Casa” is house. 
Ben: Oh yeah.


Ted looks bored thinking of a new subject
Ben: are you a grad student?
Ted: I graduated from UCLA
Ben: already graduated?
Ted: I am in a laboratory (ShiYanShi)
Ben : ShiYanShi?
Ted: Lab
Ben: what do you do?
Ted: Biology, yeah, it’s not bad, we’ll see. You used to study electrical eng?
Ben: ZH/ENG at the upper levels CS and EE are not too different. The employers don’t care. You take computer courses and can build computer courses. Now I work in a finance (jinrong) bank. I am not a bank teller, but doing investment craziness. 
Ted: Jinrong?
Ben: software. I forgot how to say SW. How do you say teams?
Ted: I forgot how to say teams - for sports teams it’s just Dui but I don’t know about work teams.
Ben looks down at his phone to translate the word for work teams.
Ben: if you dont have this app you should really get it. It’s so good you want to pay for it.
Ted: What time do we leave? 
Joe overhears him and cuts in.
Joe: you can leave any time
Ben: when it’s warmer people go to Korea town for food or whatever.
Ted: It’s getting late and I probably have to leave soon. how do you like your job at the bank?
Ben: it’s pretty good?
Ted: pretty hard work (xinku)
Ben: what’s xinku?
Ted: it means you have to work hard
Ben: it ebbs and flows. Jia Ru
Me: Jia ru?
Ben: holiday
Me: holiday (jie re)!
Ben: oh yeah- jie re.
Ted: are you very busy?
Ben: sometimes
Ted: extremely?
Ben: official work? Or real work? Officially you get paid by the week. This time of year is very busy. So ten minutes (he might have meant to say hours here)
Ted: so you always have to be there?
Ben: I can work from home. My work is very big, so my boss makes me wear this kind of clothes 
Ben waves his hand to indciate his suit and coat. 
Ben: im not sure security will let you in  - he throws his thumb back, indicating security kicking people out - I can take it off once i’m in the office. You get used to it pretty quickly. I feel weird where I don’t wear it.
I speak up, telling them how my friend thought that by making everyone where a uniform at banks, they kind of erase class differences that might be more visible in startups where people are encouraged to wear whatever they want.


Ben: you can get the whole suit very cheap. Like $100 for a whole suit.
Ted: yeah you need to be nitpicky to spot the difference
Ben: yeah i am not customer facing, if i was they would insist I wear that expensive suit.
Ted: really? What about if clients see you
Ben: yeah in the lobby. If i was customer facing they’d say to wear a gold watch and get a haircut every week. JPmorgan does house mortgages and it’s lowers stake. Morgan stanley does more of the corporate market.
Ted: cool I’ve learned lot
Ted: I live in williamsburg in an illegal situation so its cheaper


I mention that I used to rent out my extra room in East Village to afford the rent here.

Ben: My Landlord (we look up that word, as well as the word for tenant)... if you’re a tenant you’re literally a house “guest” (房客)

This is one of the cases where we chinese-learners can look at the words in chinese and find pieces that come from different words, to help us remember them better.


Ben: Now I realize that the landlord will rent the apartment thing to AirBnB
Ted: we have a big problem with that in SF. People basically circumvent the taxes and hotel laws.
Ben: if it gets any worse…. You know a landlord doesn’t have to live there. But they don’t need the microentrepreneurs.
Ben: where did you find your apartment?
Ted: Facebook, search, room, hosts
Ted uses the few words to explain, without much connecting  grammar.


Ben: so your… how do you say roommate… so your roommate...

[...]

Some time passes and now Scotty, the Taiwanese girl is talking with us.

Scotty: have you been to any asian countries?
Ben: I’ve never been. But I often to go flushing.
Scotty: what is the most difficult thing when you learn mandarin?
Ben: people speak very quickly
Scotty: yeah we get carried away. What about pronunciation?
Ben: after about 3 months we get used to it. I learned a song -  “bopomofu” song - it’s like ABCs for mandarin. 
Scotty: wow that’s pretty impressive
Ben: the most difficult part is “zi shi ci”
Scotty: how do you learn mandarin
Ben: meetup helped alot. I started coming to meetups.
David: how did you get a base? 
Ben: (hesitating…) I was working in Flushing? When i came to the meetup my mandarin was garbage. When I came with my friend it got better.


Everyone is smiling as they have this conversation.
Bingbing, the guy in the grey sweater looked bored, scratching his head, seemingly stuck between two different conversations, batting an empty juice bottle back and forth between his hands.


Scotty: who chose your chinese name for you?
Ben: My friend picked some names for me to choose and I choose it. I asked ‘how’s this name’, and she said ‘it’s bad’
Scotty: And your last name?
Seemingly embarrassedly Ben says, it’s too hard too hard
Scotty: it’s too hard?
Ben: my parents are african - it’s Anowhuani. In the US we never use last names. In my office i don’t even know my coworkers’ last names
Scotty:  I thought it was more polite
Ben: but around the office we just use first names.


At the end of the table people are all chinese speaking chinese together. Engaged in a great conversation. Since they are a majority chinese group and we are a majority english-speaking group I wonder if as the hour wears on we are getting more tired and defaulting more and more to our native language.

David asks Scotty why she chose such a masculine american name and she insists that in fact Scotty is also a girl’s name, but most people just don’t know it.

The americans here ask Scotty how to write her surname, and she traces it out on the table with her index finger. Her tracing leaves no mark on the wood tabletop, but if we already knew the character it is possible we could have recognized it by the gesture of writing. It is too hard to hear her description of what other words share the character in Scotty’s surname. And since we have limited knowledge of characters, Ben offers her his phone to write it on the app.

Scotty offers to give David a new chinese name. Since the transliteration his girlfriend chose for him is very common.
.


Scotty: sometimes we will consult a fortune-teller when choosing a name, when trying to name a child
Ben tries to guess how to say fortune teller.
Scotty: Fortune teller (suanming shi)
Ben: my good friend... teacher - went to a fortune teller to get a new given name in chinese. I don’t even know why. The fortune teller told get to do it, and charged her for it!
Scotty: but your names have meanings too right?
Ben: not anymore


As time goes on people look more and more tired. And talk less animatedly, closing their arms in front of their body and occasionally looking around the room.

All of a sudden the group at the other end of the table stands up and starts to put on their jackets. This seems to serve as a signal to the rest of us that the meetup is over for the evening as well. As it’s wrapping up, Kaiyi, the thin chinese guy with a slightly pockmarked face who was talking to the elderly Fernando, walks over to Ben and shakes his hand to say goodbye.

I walk out with some of the members. A few of us get on the same train and continue talking as we head South until I get off at my stop, saying goodbye to everyone.

After a minute or two a fourth person arrives, we can call him Mark. Mark is tall, white, with blue eyes and light brown hair. Mark introduces himself in Chinese. This is his first time at the meetup group. We speak, switching back and forth between Chinese as we go.
Topic: Introductions


IPs + NPs speaking in Mandarin

Mark asks if Joe is “jeesee” which confuses us, perhaps this is a chinese word we don’t know or that Mark is mispronouncing. After a few seconds we realize he was saying “GC” i.e. group coordinator. We realize that he is trying to ask if Joe is the organizer to which we say no, laughing.

Topic: Meetup

Mark asks Joe what province (assumedly in China) Joe is from. Joe answers that he is actually from Taiwan. In return Joe asks Mark where he is from, and Mark invites us to guess. We try to guess what he is, laughing, all the while. This is Mark’s first time to the Chinese meetup group.
Topic: Backgrounds of different people


Question to draw us in (guess where he is from)
	

Eventually Joe guesses that he is Russian to which he says “yes” and everyone laughs and says “amazing” in english. I say in broken chinese “it’s not so strange” - people stare at me confused for a sec and then realize i used the wrong word for strange and correct me.

Corrected when using wrong language

At that moment another chinese man whom I will call Xiaohong in his 30s arrives and joins the conversation. He is of average height and build, with a slightly pockmarked tan face. Joe points him out as the real organizer and laughs as he introduces himself. The organizer jokingly says that Joe is a sort of informal organizer of the group. The girl who was there at the beginning says very funny!.
Topic: Meetup


Afterward Joe turns back to Mark and asks him (in chinese) how long he has studied chinese.
Mark: six years
Joe: six years!
Mark:  in Shanghai. 
Joe replies In Shanghai? You studied chinese in Shanghai? What kind of school in Shanghai?
Mark: China Eastern Normal University (hua dong shi da)
Joe: China Eastern Normal University! How great! How did you like it there?

At this point it is 6:40pm. There are now 7 people there - 5 apparently chinese and 2 white (me and the Russian guy Mark)
	

Mark explains in chinese that he is currently taking classes at the local community college. Joe switches between chinese and english and starts explaining that he himself teaches Chinese classes at the local city college and is surprised that he hasn’t seen Mark there. And then says in english “so we are both on spring break”

The other chinese people seated at the end of the table next to ashley laugh and pretend to move their chairs further away. One of the chinese girls who pulled her chair away, whom I will call MingMing says: “you guys are outsiders” causing Joe and Ashley to laugh heartily.

Joe seems to laugh very freely, although his friend Ashley seems a bit more reserved.

Topic: Taiwan vs. China

Joe: So when we make a good friend from another country we feel very confused.

As I am being very quiet taking notes at this point there seem to be roughy 5 native speakers of chinese, talking mostly to each other and to Mark the Russian guy. They speak mostly in chinese, but occasionally interject an english word - often as way of exclamation, often followed by repeating what the other person just said. E.g. “I don’t have many foreigner friends unfortunately.” others: “unfortunately”

As the group begins to get bigger, side conversations start opening up. Mark turns to his left (instead of talking across the table with Joe and Ashley), speaking to a chinese guy in a checked blue shirt who gesticulates with his hands as he speaks in chinese. Joe, now mostly listening in on the conversation, follows along saying “right, dui (right)”  switching between english and chinese as he does so.
Group splits as it gets bigger

All this while there has been a quiet guy sitting to my left, who looks chinese, and has been listening in on the conversation. I will call him Ted. He is casually dressed, with somewhat darker skin than the other chinese attendees. Joe engages him in conversation, asking in english if he speaks Chinese. Ted replies in English “I try”. When asked if he often comes to these meetups in an uncertain slow pace Ted says “I come more” which doesn’t make a ton of sense in the context. Joe understands what he is trying to say and corrects him “You are coming more and more often”

While such direct questioning might seem rude or out of place in normal conversation, in this informal setting it seems a common question to ask, and the more direct the easier for people who are new to the language.
Joe: Oohh. I am… I am.. Now Joe seems to be the one searching for words. In the end he switches to english, perhaps not having an easy way to explain. So I teach english and chinese in the city university of new york. I am a chinese professor. And I am a PhD of linguistics.
Ted: Oh okay. In new york you did your -

	Ted explains to Joe in halting Chinese that he also did a PhD. Joe asks him if he is doing a post-doc now, to which Ted replies no. Joe asks, so what kind of research are you doing? Ted replies in chinese that he is a researcher. Switching to English Joe asks, trying to clarify “what kind of researcher are you?

	[it seems that english speakers default to using english words for things that they do not know Chinese vocabulary for, and that Joe at least will also try to simplify his chinese to speak to chinese learners and switch to english himself if he feels they cannot understand.]


	At 6:44 there are two conversations going on at the same big table - Jerry and Ted and Mark and about 4-5 chinese members at the other end of the table (towards the windows).




	

	

	

	

	A Taiwanese girl with a bob haircut sits down at the other side of Joe from Ashley. I will call this girl Scotty. Ted starts talking to Scotty who is sitting across from him and who has been silent until now. Ted continues to speak a bit quietly and hesitatingly, causing Scotty to crane her head closer to him to hear, since at this point there are several conversations going on and the background music is still a bit high. When there are words Ted doesn’t understand either he or Scotty switches to using english.


	

	

	

	Girl not participating as much, more reacting to the conversation.
	A chinese student (I call Wenchao) begins engaging me in conversation, hoping to practice his english.


Wenchao asks me if I have been to these meetups before and I explain that I used to come when I first came to New York, a few years ago to practice mandarin. I tell him that I am now here for a class to analyze the meetup. I ask Wenchao if he comes very often to the meetups?


Wenchao: This one? 
Me: this one, or in general

I reply, then ask him a direct question

	He asks me what school I go to and what I major in. i tell him i am in the information systems major at nyu and that I am taking notes for my ethnography class.
	Topic: life in NYC
	

	

	

	Upon hearing what my major is Wenchao quickly asks me if I use association rules - an old fashioned machine learning technique that is not commonly used these days. I am surprised he even knew about association rules. I stutter out an answer in chinese that I do know how to use them, but do not really use them often. I explain that although I do program a bit I am trying to pick up more qualitative methods in addition to data mining techniques like deep learning.

	Wenchao then asks if I have to use TensorFlow - a popular software library used for deep learning with artificial neural networks. I explain that I do use it but that it’s not necessarily required for my major. Wenchao explains that he is majoring at business analytics at Fordham. 
	Topic: data mining


Topic: Life in NYC
	

	

	

	I reply “oh! I am a PhD and I teach business analytics!” When I ask if he then uses TensorFlow he says “no” somewhat sheepishly. “We don’t have one class to learn it, but I can learn it online.”

Topic: Life in NYC
	

	

	

	I again ask if he comes to these meetups very often and if he ever writes down words in english he doesn’t know. Wenchao explains that he comes alot. He doesn’t write down words he doesn’t know because he already studied for the GRE and picked up lots of vocabulary there,  and is now trying to pick up speaking in a more casual setting - getting practice getting up there and being bold, most people don’t use very fancy word in common speech.

	He asks me how I first started coming to the meetups here. I ended up making a friend with one of the group’s members when I first got here. I tell Wenchao that my friend and I ended up becoming running buddies and would switch of speaking english one day and chinese the next, but that was a long time ago - 2 years ago - and that friend has since moved away.

Mostly, volunteering self-information


	Wenchao switches to speaking a mix of chinese and english to me while I reply mostly in english to him.

I ask him “is it your friend or your partner?” He asks me the difference and I explain that a partner is more like a “boyfriend” if he doesn’t have more context - like in a project or a language partner or a business partner.
Topic: translating
	

Wenchao asks me how I first started to study chinese 


I explain my own introduction to the language - I went on a research program in china many years ago, came back and started taking mandarin classes in university, and now that I am in New York I can come to the meetups to practice mandarin.


Transition


Topic: Learning Chinese


- a relatively common question at these meetups - but interestingly he said how instead of why, which may be more common in chinese in general now that I think about it.
Wenchao comments that meetups are one of the great things about new york city and I concur. I ask if he has ever been to the meetups on Sunday for chinese exchange. He says he never goes to those ones, but there are other language exchange meetups that take place at a bar in which people from many different languages come and split off into smaller groups.

There’s always that moment where- I have kinda a pretty good accent so, you know- [when he switches into english his nervousness seems to go away and a note of comraderie enters his voice]
Me: they have high expectations.
Ted: Yeah exactly! [he sounds relieved that someone understands]. You know, it’s like past the simple stuff there’s always a moment where I don’t understand what anyone is saying but I’m kind of nodding, haha. There’s a point where you can’t peice together what they’re saying from the context any more.

Ted: yeah. Fujian province. They have their own dialect.
David: Yeah I notice when I go to Chinatown I don’t really understand a lot of what they are saying.
Ted: Maybe Cantonese too…
David: Yeah! Cantonese. 
Ted: Yeah. A lot of those people can speak Mandarin. They just prefer to speak, you know.
David: To their own… like if you interact with people you can definitely factor it in…. Um… um… uh...

It is apparent at this point that we have run out of things to talk about, and need to switch to a new topic. Switching into Chinese Ted picks up the conversation.
Ted: So what’s your job?
Me: I’m a graduate student (i.e. research student, “yanjiusheng”)
Ted: research what?
He repeats the word questioningly. I think he is asking me what “yanjiu” (i.e. research) means.
Me: research student (yanjiu xuesheng) like research. I’m a grad student. so...
Ted: What major?
Me: My major is uh… business? [I forget the word for business student in Mandarin] Information systems, information systems [I repeat this in english since it is an uncommon word so I want to make sure he understands.] so like Business Analytics, that kind of thing.

As we sit here speaking english there is a Chinese guy in a grey sweater I will call Bingbing who occasionally cranes his head over and tries to overhear us speaking. As we continue the conversation we continue to switch back and forth between English and Chinese. With switches occurring especially when we don’t know what to say, and when we do speak in chinese we do so in a halting, hesitating manner.


Soon afterward a tall black guy whom I call Ben joins us at our end of the table, sitting on a stool between Ted and I. Ben was dressed in a tan business suit, short cut hair, and silver-rimmed glasses. We talk about his work at a bank. He forgets momentarily how to say “interesting” and we both think of different ways to say it after a second. He explains that he is also a software engineer working for a top bank here in the city. He reminds us how to say computer as opposed to computation. I point out that the characters for computer literally mean “electric brain” and everyone goes oh, we hadn’t realized …. Ben explains that he himself has a masters in computer and electrical engineering. Ted asks him if they are very different, and Ben replies that at the advanced levels they are pretty similar. He has both programmed and computers and built them from scratch! We realize that the word for computation literally translates as calculation machine.


At this point I try to exit the conversation again so I can take notes without being so closely involved. Ben and Ted start talking and ask each other how long they’ve been speaking or learning mandarin. Ted explains again that he was born in Beijing, then moved to California where he grew up. 


As Ted and Ben have a more one-on-one conversation sitting around the corner of the large table, Bingbing, who is sitting to Ben’s left tries to raise his voice a bit and talk to David across our little corner. It is clear that there is some confusion between them partially becaue of the language barrier but also becuase there are now so many conversations going on around the table that it is getting a bit hard to hear clearly.


Going around the table clockwise, starting from the center guy in the grey hoodie: Joe, Scotty, David, Me [out of frame], Teddy [out of frame], Ben [out of frame], BingBing (talking to David), Wenchao (you can see his nose), Mark, the organizer - Xiaohong in blue. The pair in the right of the frame are also part of the meetup group and sat together talking the whole time behind Xiaohong. 


Apart from me nobody moved from the seats they took at first. Although people would pivot between conversation partners, to the left and right. An interesting observation from this night is that at our end of the table we had four out of the seven non-native chinese speakers culstered together. While at the other end of the table, there was only one non-native speaker (Mark). The two pairs that split off from the main table were mixed chinese and non-chinese: the young bald white guy and chinese girl in the right of the photo, and the elderly white man whom I will call Shawn and Kaiyi, the skinny tall chinese guy sitting behind Xiaohong, the organizer.


Looking around the room at 7:18 I see 16 attendees and 6 different conversations- four at the big table, and two pairs off to the sides. From what I could tell there were four White Americans (two of us from the SF Bay Area), one Black American - Ben (born in Kenya, grew up in New Jersey), one Asian American - Teddy (grew up in SF, went to school in UCLA), one Russian - Mark, three Taiwanese - Joe, Ashley, and Scotty, and six people from Mainland China. Nearly everyone looked to be between 25-35 except the elderly Fernando. 


Most people are bent intently over the table, clearly engaged in their conversations. 


Ben has pretty good chinese - as good as any of us other non-native speakers - and says that he learned all on own, merely by speaking with friends, and going to meetups and, and practicing writing every day. 
I ask Ben, impressed, if he really practices writing every day?! Ben takes out his iphone, and show us an app called Skritter.
  

^An image of the app Skritter


Ben demonstrates that by tracing characters with his finger he can practice writing. If he writes the wrong stroke it won’t appear on the screen - forcing him to try again to learn. Ben angles his phone to show to Ted, demonstrating writing things with his index finger as he goes.


Ted asks Ben if he uses wechat. Ben shows us briefly the many alerts for messages he has received recently from friends that are all written in chinese. He received them in wechat - an app similar to wechat or facebook messenger that is very popular in china, and with chinese expats in the US. 


Ben also tells us about another favorite app of his - called Pleco - an offline english-to-chinese dictionary.
Ben: I actually think without it I wouldn’t be this far. It’s so good, it seems unfair.
Me: Yeah I agree, I use the flash-card function on it, although I guess that lost of other apps have that function to.
… we look around for a few moments thinking of something else to say.


Ted asks Ben in chinese if he has been to China to which Ben replies “no, I have never gone.”
Ted: I’ve gone a few times. If you could go to china where would you go?
Ben: probably taiwan, if china then i’d like to spend a week in Chengjung
Ted: I think you need a visa to go to Taiwan
Ben: yeah you need a visa or something, but for americans you don’t need anything. They don’t require anything, they want people to go.
Ted: I am a chinese citizen, so when I want to go to the UK next month I need to apply for a visa and pay $150. My friend went to london, and france
Ted then puts up his hands in exasperation and nervousness
Ben: where do you live?
Ted: Williamsburg
Ben: where were you born?
Ted: beijing. 1 year old.
Ben: where did you move when you were 1
Ted: California (jiazhou) 
Ben : jiazhou? Wait give me a second - california? I drove a car there and back! Just one time
Ted: how long did it take?
Ben: From NY to Chicago, then Denver, to see friends. In chicago and denver i have many friends,
Ted says mmm mmm mm each time in between the pauses in Ben’s story, to indicate that he has heard and understood.
Ben: how do you say gasoline? 
Ted: QiYou
Ben: we ran out of oil. We stopped in Vegas because we had to. It was directly on the way and we had no other way, so we stopped the car for a few hours (laughing)
Ted: how long?
Ben: 3 hours. My other friends didn’t have money. (switching to english) they gambled and lost a lot of money - FAST
Ted: I would say they lost a lot of money.
Ben: how do you say lost? “Milule” is saying you got lost. Giving the chinese and gambling there’s probably a word for that.


At this point Ben opens app on his phone to look up the word. Ben shows it to Ted and says “kuile (亏了)” which sounds like “quay-luh” in english.
Ted, reading the pinyin off the screen says “kwee-luh”.
Ben: “quay-luh”
Ted: oh, “quay-luh”


Ben: my friend had no money, but I had money. Laughs, I just watched him gamble. we went to LA and went to a suburb with a walmart, do you know that suburb? 
Ted: no...
Ben: All I know is that it was hilly and there were lots of chinese people. But In LA there are way more chinese people overall than in New Jersey so I bet anywhere I went would seem like tons of Asians...
Ted: Gabrial Park, San Marion … asian beverly hills.
Ben: but that was before the ultra-wealthy moved in. now millionaires move in, buy a house and leave it empty. That’s what i've heard
Ted: yeah, I bet that if their kids go to american schools...
Ben: chinese people love american schools
…
As Ben and Ted continue to talk I look around the room. Most people most ppl seem engaged deeply in conversation. There is one convo off to the side between a bald white guy and a chinese girl in her late 20s wearing a blue long-sleeve sweater with thin white horizontal stripes. At the end of the table there is Fernando, a regular with grey hair, balding, talking to another chinese guy apart from the rest of the people around the bigger table. Then Kaiyi nods as Fernando peers through his bushy eyebrows and gestures emphatically with his hands while he is talking.


There are many people smiling and laughing, only one or two people listening along silently and occasionally nodding.


Back to the conversation between Ben and Ted.


Ben: My parents were born in africa, but I was born in New Jersey
Ted: What part?
Ben: Eastern part of Africa - sometimes they say North East …. But they mean Eastern
Ted: How do you say Kenya? what do they speak in Kenya?
Ben: Swahili 
Ben: Kenya has two languages - swahili and english. speaking english is not hard for my parents. Coming here wasn’t a big deal to them. But sometimes they would mix things up. I could go back to kenya if i read a few books.
Ted: Is there any other language you want to learn?
Ben: Korean…. Swahili is not as used. If I speaks swahili, my parents would be very happy. It’s way easier!
Ted: Chinese is easier!?
Ben: Swahili is easier. It uses latin characters. Latin characters. The grammar is similar to english grammar. In Kenya, is in the hindu region. In english swahili is a mix of many languages - portuguese, hindu, bantu, etc. “Casa” is table in both portuguese and swahili
Me: you mean “mesa”? “Casa” is house. 
Ben: Oh yeah.


Ted looks bored thinking of a new subject
Ben: are you a grad student?
Ted: I graduated from UCLA
Ben: already graduated?
Ted: I am in a laboratory (ShiYanShi)
Ben : ShiYanShi?
Ted: Lab
Ben: what do you do?
Ted: Biology, yeah, it’s not bad, we’ll see. You used to study electrical eng?
Ben: ZH/ENG at the upper levels CS and EE are not too different. The employers don’t care. You take computer courses and can build computer courses. Now I work in a finance (jinrong) bank. I am not a bank teller, but doing investment craziness. 
Ted: Jinrong?
Ben: software. I forgot how to say SW. How do you say teams?
Ted: I forgot how to say teams - for sports teams it’s just Dui but I don’t know about work teams.
Ben looks down at his phone to translate the word for work teams.
Ben: if you dont have this app you should really get it. It’s so good you want to pay for it.
Ted: What time do we leave? 
Joe overhears him and cuts in.
Joe: you can leave any time
Ben: when it’s warmer people go to Korea town for food or whatever.
Ted: It’s getting late and I probably have to leave soon. how do you like your job at the bank?
Ben: it’s pretty good?
Ted: pretty hard work (xinku)
Ben: what’s xinku?
Ted: it means you have to work hard
Ben: it ebbs and flows. Jia Ru
Me: Jia ru?
Ben: holiday
Me: holiday (jie re)!
Ben: oh yeah- jie re.
Ted: are you very busy?
Ben: sometimes
Ted: extremely?
Ben: official work? Or real work? Officially you get paid by the week. This time of year is very busy. So ten minutes (he might have meant to say hours here)
Ted: so you always have to be there?
Ben: I can work from home. My work is very big, so my boss makes me wear this kind of clothes 
Ben waves his hand to indciate his suit and coat. 
Ben: im not sure security will let you in  - he throws his thumb back, indicating security kicking people out - I can take it off once i’m in the office. You get used to it pretty quickly. I feel weird where I don’t wear it.
I speak up, telling them how my friend thought that by making everyone where a uniform at banks, they kind of erase class differences that might be more visible in startups where people are encouraged to wear whatever they want.


Ben: you can get the whole suit very cheap. Like $100 for a whole suit.
Ted: yeah you need to be nitpicky to spot the difference
Ben: yeah i am not customer facing, if i was they would insist I wear that expensive suit.
Ted: really? What about if clients see you
Ben: yeah in the lobby. If i was customer facing they’d say to wear a gold watch and get a haircut every week. JPmorgan does house mortgages and it’s lowers stake. Morgan stanley does more of the corporate market.
Ted: cool I’ve learned lot
Ted: I live in williamsburg in an illegal situation so its cheaper


I mention that I used to rent out my extra room in East Village to afford the rent here.


Ben: My Landlord (we look up that word, as well as the word for tenant)... if you’re a tenant you’re literally a house “guest” (房客)


This is one of the cases where we chinese-learners can look at the words in chinese and find pieces that come from different words, to help us remember them better.


Ben: Now I realize that the landlord will rent the apartment thing to AirBnB
Ted: we have a big problem with that in SF. People basically circumvent the taxes and hotel laws.
Ben: if it gets any worse…. You know a landlord doesn’t have to live there. But they don’t need the microentrepreneurs.
Ben: where did you find your apartment?
Ted: Facebook, search, room, hosts
Ted uses the few words to explain, without much connecting  grammar.


Ben: so your… how do you say roommate… so your roommate...


[...]


Some time passes and now Scotty, the Taiwanese girl is talking with us.


Scotty: have you been to any asian countries?
Ben: I’ve never been. But I often to go flushing.
Scotty: what is the most difficult thing when you learn mandarin?
Ben: people speak very quickly
Scotty: yeah we get carried away. What about pronunciation?
Ben: after about 3 months we get used to it. I learned a song -  “bopomofu” song - it’s like ABCs for mandarin. 
Scotty: wow that’s pretty impressive
Ben: the most difficult part is “zi shi ci”
Scotty: how do you learn mandarin
Ben: meetup helped alot. I started coming to meetups.
David: how did you get a base? 
Ben: (hesitating…) I was working in Flushing? When i came to the meetup my mandarin was garbage. When I came with my friend it got better.


Everyone is smiling as they have this conversation.
Bingbing, the guy in the grey sweater looked bored, scratching his head, seemingly stuck between two different conversations, batting an empty juice bottle back and forth between his hands.


Scotty: who chose your chinese name for you?
Ben: My friend picked some names for me to choose and I choose it. I asked ‘how’s this name’, and she said ‘it’s bad’
Scotty: And your last name?
Seemingly embarrassedly Ben says, it’s too hard too hard
Scotty: it’s too hard?
Ben: my parents are african - it’s Anowhuani. In the US we never use last names. In my office i don’t even know my coworkers’ last names
Scotty:  I thought it was more polite
Ben: but around the office we just use first names.


At the end of the table people are all chinese speaking chinese together. Engaged in a great conversation. Since they are a majority chinese group and we are a majority english-speaking group I wonder if as the hour wears on we are getting more tired and defaulting more and more to our native language.


David asks Scotty why she chose such a masculine american name and she insists that in fact Scotty is also a girl’s name, but most people just don’t know it.


The americans here ask Scotty how to write her surname, and she traces it out on the table with her index finger. Her tracing leaves no mark on the wood tabletop, but if we already knew the character it is possible we could have recognized it by the gesture of writing. It is too hard to hear her description of what other words share the character in Scotty’s surname. And since we have limited knowledge of characters, Ben offers her his phone to write it on the app.


Scotty offers to give David a new chinese name. Since the transliteration his girlfriend chose for him is very common.
.


Scotty: sometimes we will consult a fortune-teller when choosing a name, when trying to name a child
Ben tries to guess how to say fortune teller.
Scotty: Fortune teller (suanming shi)
Ben: my good friend... teacher - went to a fortune teller to get a new given name in chinese. I don’t even know why. The fortune teller told get to do it, and charged her for it!
Scotty: but your names have meanings too right?
Ben: not anymore




As time goes on people look more and more tired. And talk less animatedly, closing their arms in front of their body and occasionally looking around the room.


All of a sudden the group at the other end of the table stands up and starts to put on their jackets. This seems to serve as a signal to the rest of us that the meetup is over for the evening as well. As it’s wrapping up, Kaiyi, the thin chinese guy with a slightly pockmarked face who was talking to the elderly Fernando, walks over to Ben and shakes his hand to say goodbye.


I walk out with some of the members. A few of us get on the same train and continue talking as we head South until I get off at my stop, saying goodbye to everyone.
