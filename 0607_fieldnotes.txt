June 8 Field Notes: Chinese Meetup, Pret a Manger


Observations
	Interpretations / notes
	I arrived early today at the cafe, Pret a Manger and sat at a side table away from where people usually sit, closer to the window and doing some other work while I waited for people to arrive. The cafe was mostly empty - probably only 5% of the seats were occupied.
	

	At 6:30pm when the meetup officially began, until 6:32 there was just one person sitting in the middle of the long main table where meetups usually occur. Seated there was a girl I will call “YY”. 
The music is still quite loud playing dance pop music, currently playing the song “Kill them with Kindness”
	

	YY is a medium-height, thin Chinese American woman (as I would later find out) in her mid-20s. She had straight shoulder-length hair, dark blue semi-formal shirt, a siverly necklace, dangly earrings. 
	New person - YY
semi-formal clothing.
She looked a bit nervous seated there on her own.


	Ben, a medium-height bald white American guy in his mid-20s is the second one to sit down at the table with YY. Seeing this, I also get up and move over to sit next to Ben, across from YY.


	Ben from a prior day
  

	YY asks me and Ben in Chinese if this is our first time coming to this meetup group. She tells us that it is her first time coming to the group. Ben tells us th
	I find it interesting that even though YY hasn’t been to the meetup before, she sat at precisely the right table. I guess it was a large table in the middle with no one sitting at it and was the natural place to come. Maybe the meetup.com page also indicated this was the right table.

R: There a lot of places - it’s like there’s a lot of little places in the United States. Unfortunately a lot them have the same name. [He is trying to explain why he doesn’t know about Xiamen]. Unless you say the state and the county, you don’t really know where it is.

普通話 廣東話不懂
CG: 那你媽媽跟你不說廣東話？
NC: 不說
CG: 可以跟他們說....就教你最久了
NC: 對可是我要找些別的人學，因為就是...就是別的，我學的時候有一點不自信。
CG: 不自信？就是你跟你爸爸媽媽說的時候，你不自信就是跟你爸爸媽媽說的時候，還是跟別人說？
NC: 跟別人說


CG: 為什麼，就是你不懂，你說那個...這些話題還是，你不能表達出來。
NC: 對，有些聽上去我不會表達，
CG: 因為你知道那個字怎麼說？
NC: 對, 還是不知道那個字是什麼
GC: 這樣你這樣看多一點書應該可以。但是你的表達能力，應沒關係啊，就是因為就是那個話題的內容不知道吧。
NC: 有的時候yeah
CG:  對


NC: 你們怎麼覺學的呢？
CG: 看多一點書啊 就是微信也看啊，因為我們有的時候，看微信的時候，都是我們自己經常看的東西，像運動... 去看別的東西。
NC: 可是如果我不會讀呢？
CG: 
NC: 看不懂
CG: 聽多一點吧。Podcast, youtube上面去看視頻。看電視節目，節目也跟那個娛樂。電影，一般都說的都沒有什麼新的...差不多。有看不同的節目吧：向歷史的東西娛樂的東西就是你聽 看那個內容 可以用的生字。因為你用的生字，從這裡可以找到，因為中文的語法，都是這樣。只是那個自用的不同。不懂的話題，不懂的字，就這樣子。對吧？有興趣的都看看。我沒有興趣的都看看，短短的。我以前不看的，但是現在都看一點點。Get away from what i’m comfortable with.

[impossible]

CG: 每個禮拜四六點半。
NC: 多點人要學中文還是多點人要學英文？
CG: 很難說。像今天現在這個情況就是學中文的。有一些就是來聊天。現在就是很多學生剛剛畢業。現在很多那個大學生，很多。
