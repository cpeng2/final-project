# final-project

This project counts word occurrences in my field notes. The field notes were taken at NYC Mandarin/ English meetups, where Mandarin learners come to practice with native speakers. The goals of this project are 1) count overall word occurrences, 2) count word occurrences used by males and females, and 3) label positive and negative words to conduct a sentiment analysis (stretch goal).

Updates from last time:
1) Names are now set to be `frozenset.`
2) Punctuations are removed using `string.punctuation`.
3) Regular expressions were added to extract the actual quotes.
4) The codes for `assign_gender` were revised, where I also left a question.
